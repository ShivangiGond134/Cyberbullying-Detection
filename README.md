Cyberbullying Detection using CNN and NLP

This project uses Natural Language Processing and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect cyberbullying in social media text. It involves text preprocessing, tokenization, embedding, and training a CNN-based model to classify posts as cyberbullying or not. The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. It aims to contribute to safer online environments by identifying harmful language automatically.
